# Shawarma_Swarm
Messing around with swarms and swarming algorithms

## Goal
Make 'swarms' self-organize in a variety of dimensions.

## Phases

| Phase | Dimension | Multi-Threaded |
| :---: | :-------: | :------------: |
| 1     | 1         | No             |
| 2     | 2         | No             |
| 3     | 2         | Yes            |
| 4     | 3?        | Yes            |
